      "Language models are trained using a type of artificial intelligence called machine learning. This involves giving a computer a lot of data, in this case text, and teaching it to recognize patterns in the data. The computer then uses these patterns to make predictions about new data it has never seen before. In the case of language models, the computer is taught to recognize patterns in language and is able to generate new sentences that follow the same rules. To train a language model, the computer is shown millions of examples of sentences and is asked to predict the correct words for the next sentence in the sequence. The computer then adjusts its predictions based on the feedback it gets from the examples it has seen. After many iterations, the language model is able to generate new sentences that are grammatically correct and have the same meaning as the examples it has been shown.\n"
